I just completed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset! ðŸŒ¸ðŸ“Š This classic dataset is widely used for machine learning and statistical analysis, containing sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris species.

 In this analysis, I explored:
 
 âœ… Distribution of features across species 
 
âœ… Correlations between attributes 

âœ… Visualizing patterns using scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots 

âœ… Identifying clusters for classification 

Used Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover insights and create meaningful visualizations. Excited to share my findings! ðŸš€
